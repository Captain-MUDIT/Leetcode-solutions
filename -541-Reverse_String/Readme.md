🔄 Reverse String II 🌀
👋 Welcome to the Reverse String II project! This function reverses segments of a string based on given intervals. It's simple yet quite powerful. Let's dive into the details! 🏊‍♂️

📚 Problem Statement
Given a string s and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the others as original.

🛠️ Constraints
The string length is in the range [1, 10000].

The string consists of only lowercase English letters.

1 <= k <= s.length

🌟 Example
Example 1
Input:

s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output:

"bacdfeg"
Example 2
Input:

s = "abcd", k = 4
Output:

"dcba"
🚀 How It Works
Initialization:

Convert the string s to a list of characters to facilitate in-place modifications.

Iteration:

Iterate over the string in segments of 2k characters.

For each segment, reverse the first k characters using Python's slicing and reversing features.

Join and Return:

Convert the list back to a string and return the result
